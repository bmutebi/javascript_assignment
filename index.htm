	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>This is a JavaScript assignment covering use of comparison operators and loops (do, while and for loop). They are all console applications looking at different aspects.</p>
	
	<h2>Use of loops</h2>
	<p>The loop section, we started with <code>for loop</code> that helps in displaying numbers from 1 to 10. Then we went ahead to write an application that uses an array to store names of different people. We use the <code>for loop</code>, <code>do loop</code> and <code>while loop</code> to display all the names in this array.</p>
	
	<h2>Comparison operators</h2>
	<p>For the second section of the comparison operators, we started with using tenary operator that uses the value supplied to the height variable to determine whether it has been assigned a value or not.</p>

	<p>The second part of this same section, we decide to come up with a MTN Mobile Money application to be used to determine the new sending charge fee depending on the amount supplied. </p>
